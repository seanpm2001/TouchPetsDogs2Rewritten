# TouchPetsDogs2Rewritten
A recreation of the old iOS game "Touch Pets Dogs 2" by ngmoco. The game has been shut down for over 7 years, and I have really missed it.

***

## About

Touch Pets Dogs 2 is a game about taking care of virtual dogs. You can feed them, clean up after them, dress them up, play with them, and more.

***

## Why the recreation?


It was a game from my early childhood, and I really miss it. It no longer exists, as the servers went down almost a whole decade ago. ngmoco isn't even an active company anymore (no activity in over 4 years)

***

* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (and later LTS versions)

* Fedora 16 and up
