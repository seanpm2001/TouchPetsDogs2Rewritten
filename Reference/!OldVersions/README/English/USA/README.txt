## Reverse engineering

Thanks to GitHub user [:octocat: `@knot126`](https://github.com/knot126/) for reverse-engineering the game code, and getting it to run partially without a server connection. I would follow this user, and star and fork this repository, but GitHub keeps giving me the error "You can't perform that action at this time" every time I try.
