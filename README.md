Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools_IDE_Markdown/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

## About

Touch Pets Dogs 2 is a game about taking care of virtual dogs. You can feed them, clean up after them, dress them up, play with them, and more.

***

## Why the recreation

**Why are you recreating this game?**

It was a game from my early childhood, and I really miss it. It no longer exists, as the servers went down almost a whole decade ago. ngmoco isn't even an active company anymore (no activity in over 4 years) I really liked the game, and it would be nice to have in the modern day.

***
